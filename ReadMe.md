# Sample pygame code to draw a rectangle and move it up and down using
  the a and d keys.

Restore the python virtual environment and activate before running.

	python -m venv .\venv
	.\.venv\Scripts\Activate
	pip install -r requirements.txt

Freeze the (activated) environment after any update and before saving
using:

       pip freeze > requirements.txt

Free IDEs that are worth looking at are:

- Visual Studio Code with Python support instaled https://code.visualstudio.com/
- PyCharm Community Edition at https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=windows

I think these also support python coding but haven't tried them...

- Eclipse https://www.eclipse.org/topics/ide/
